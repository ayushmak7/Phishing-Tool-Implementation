# üé£Phishing Attack Using Zphisher

## Introduction

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers, often through email or text messages, impersonate legitimate entities to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or clicking malicious links, ultimately aiming to steal data or install malware. 

## Objectives

Demonstrate how attackers create malicious links to embed into fraudulent emails, messages and login pages to capture user credentials phishing tools such as Zphisher.


## Tools 

Zphisher - to create phising login pages. It is an automated phishing tool that offers phishing templates for 33 popular websites.

Kali Linux - VM we will use to download Zphisher.

Email - craft email content that will increase the likelihood of recipients opening the emails and clicking on the links.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
**If you‚Äôre using Zphisher for educational purposes, ensure that:**

‚úÖ You have explicit permission from your organization or training participants.

‚úÖ It is done in a safe lab environment (not on live networks or real accounts).

‚úÖ No personal data is misused.


## Part 1 ‚Äì Installing and Configuring Zphisher

1. Before downloading Zphisher, update Kali Linux terminal by running the following commands and to ensure that environment was conducive for Zphisher to function
   - sudo apt update
   - sudo apt full-upgrade -y

2. Create Zphisher directory and navigate into it using the following commands in succession.
   - mkdir zphisher
   - cd zphisher

3. Install & Set Up Zphisher
   - Install necessary dependencies.
   - Clone the Zphisher repository using this url https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git and launch the tool.

4.  Navigate to the downloaded ‚Äúzphisher‚Äù directory to see the files within by running the following commands:
      - cd zphisher
      - ls

![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/4.png?raw=true)


5. Run the Zphisher script (contained in the zphisher.sh shell script file) by executing the following command:
      - bash zphisher.sh

![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/5.png?raw=true)


6. A page opens with phishing page templates giving options of the type of phishing attacks that to can be performed by entering the corresponding number.

      - Upon typing the preferred option (e.g.14) against the ‚Äúselect option‚Äù prompt

7. Zphisher provides three tunneling options: Localhost, Cloudflared, and LocalXpose.

   - Localhost allows you to access your local server using a local IP address, typically 127.0.0.1 or localhost and is useful for testing your server on your own machine.
   - Cloudflared exposes your local server to the internet using a secure tunnel. It is useful for accessing your server from anywhere, while keeping your traffic encrypted.
   - LocalXpose uses LocalXpose's reverse proxy to expose your local server to the internet. This is similar to cloudflared, but with a simpler setup process. 

   Upon typing the preferred option (e.g.1) for the ‚Äúport forwarding service‚Äù
 
   Upon typing the preferred option (e.g. n for No) in response to the question ‚ÄúDo you want a Custom Port [y/N]‚Äù
   
   ![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/8.png?raw=true)



8. It confirms launching Localhost and initializes and hosts the page at http://127.0.0.1:8080, which directs the browser to make a TCP connection to port 8080 of the local loopback address 127.0.0.1 known as "localhost". The loopback address is a special IP address that always refers back to the current device, allowing it to connect to itself.


![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/9.png?raw=true)


9. Copy & paste this http://127.0.0.1:8080 onto a browser page, it opens a Linkedin login page that appeared legitimate. The user name and the password you type in will be harvested in the zphisher tool.

When an attacker sends phishing emails with the generated phishing links to the target, the target clicks the link to the malicious website, which can potentially deceive them into trusting the malicious website, potentially resulting in them falling victim to a phishing attack and their credentials being harvested in realtime on zphisher. Example below:


![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/10.png?raw=true)

![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/11.png?raw=true)



10. Once the victim enters their credentials, they will be displayed in the terminal as shown in the two images below:


![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/12.png?raw=true)


![alt zphisher](https://github.com/ayushmak7/Phishing-Tool-Implementation/blob/main/images/13.png?raw=true)

The image above containing credentials identical to the preceding image represents credentials harvested from Yush‚Äôs target network. 





## **Mitigating Phishing Attacks**

By implementing a multi-layered defence strategy that includes staff education, regular simulated phishing campaigns, email filtering tools, DMARC records, multi-factor authentication (MFA), separate work and personal devices, established mail providers like Gmail or Office 365, and access control and privilege management policies, organizations and individuals can reduce the risk of phishing attacks and protect their sensitive information.


Conducting staff education is a critical component of phishing attack mitigation. Employees should be trained to recognize and respond to phishing attacks, including how to identify suspicious emails, how to verify the sender's identity, and how to report phishing attempts. 

Regular simulated phishing campaigns can help employees stay vigilant and improve their phishing recognition skills.

Implementing email filtering tools can help detect and block phishing emails before they reach the user's inbox. These tools use a variety of techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, reputation analysis, and content analysis, to identify and filter out phishing emails.

Publishing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) helps prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks. By publishing a DMARC record, organizations can specify how their email domains should be authenticated and what should happen to unauthenticated emails. This can help prevent attackers from sending phishing emails that appear to come from a legitimate domain. The DMARC record specifies the policy for handling emails that fail the authentication checks, such as quarantine or reject. 

Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) will ensure that users to provide multiple forms of authentication before accessing a system or application. This can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a security token), or something the user is (such as a biometric factor). MFA can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information, even if they have obtained the user's password.

Implementing separate work and personal devices policy can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information through personal devices that may not have the same level of security as work devices. This can include using separate devices for work and personal email, social media, and other online activities.

Using established mail providers like Gmail or Office 365, to offer advanced security features that can help detect and block phishing attacks. These features may include email filtering, spam blocking, and anti-phishing tools.

Implementing access control and privilege management policies can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information by limiting access to authorized users and devices. This can include implementing role-based access control (RBAC), which restricts access to specific roles or job functions, and implementing least privilege principles, which limit access to the minimum level required to perform a task.
