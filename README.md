# üé£Phishing Simulation for Security Awareness Using Zphisher

## Introduction

A sophisticated phishing attack tricked LastPass users into revealing their master passwords. CryptoChameleon attackers bypassed even diligent users, highlighting the human factor as cybersecurity‚Äôs greatest vulnerability. 

The purpose of this project is to raise security awareness and educate employees/users on Social engineering, especially phishing, which is a cybersecurity threat that manipulates people to reveal confidential information through email and malicious websites. 



## Objectives

- Demonstrate how attackers use fake login pages to trick users and their capture user credentials using phishing tools such as Zphisher.
- Teach phishing detection techniques, such as checking URLs, avoiding suspicious emails, and using MFA.


## Tools 

Zphisher - an automated phishing tool that is used to create phishing login pages.
Kali Linux - the VM we will use to download zphisher and get it to work
Email - craft email content that will increase the likelihood of recipients opening the emails and clicking on the links.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è
**If you‚Äôre using Zphisher for educational purposes, ensure that:**

‚úÖ You have explicit permission from your organization or training participants.

‚úÖ It is done in a safe lab environment (not on live networks or real accounts).

‚úÖ No personal data is misused.


Part 1 ‚Äì Research

In a recent phishing incident, a highly sophisticated phishing campaign led LastPass users to give up their all-important master passwords to hackers. CryptoChameleon attackers tricked even the most diligent user into handing over their high-value credentials, underscoring the belief that the human factor is the greatest cyber vulnerability.

These findings whetted our appetite for research into phishing tools that could be used to educate people and help reduce the greatest cyber vulnerability - the human factor. The phishing tool we had in mind would according to NIST guidelines be used in penetration testing: 
To evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's security awareness training programs.
To simulate real-world phishing attacks and identify parts for improvement.
Help organizations understand the tactics used by malicious actors and enhance their security measures.

We watched many videos and read about many phishing tools and how to use them. Finally, we settled on Zphisher, an open-source, automated phishing tool written in Node.js by HRT-Tech with 30+ templates that can be customized to help penetration testers and cybersecurity professionals create phishing pages quickly and easily. Zphisher is a powerful open-source tool used for phishing attacks. It has gained popularity due to its ease of use and the wide range of phishing templates it offers for various popular websites such as Facebook, Instagram, Google, Snapchat, GitHub, Yahoo, Proton mail, Spotify, Netflix, LinkedIn, WordPress, Origin, Steam, and Microsoft, among others. 

We found it the most practical to use, given our circumstances and the time frame we had to demonstrate how to install and use it to create an immediate and tangible outcome. We researched how to configure the device to harvest credentials and realized it was more appropriate and safe to run it on Kali Linux.

The image below shows the Zphisher page on GitHub, which gives details about the tool, such as the logo, the url link to the page, the community involved in creating it and the disclaimer that warns that actions and or activities a zphisher user chooses to use the tool for is their responsibility and that misusing it may result in criminal charges. This is because using Zphisher for unauthorized purposes is illegal and unethical. It is recommended only for educational purposes and with the permission of the owners of the targeted system.

Our findings on Zphisher were as follows:

Being an open-source tool, it is free to use and can be modified to suit the user's needs, to obtain credentials such as user ID and password and IP addresses by cloning the repository and running the script using the command "bash zphisher.sh". 
We found that Zphisher is designed to run on Kali Linux, a popular operating system for ethical hacking and penetration testing. 
Zphisher has a simple and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both beginners and experienced users to perform phishing attacks. It allows users to create custom templates, giving them more flexibility and control over their phishing attacks.
Zphisher offers phishing templates for 33 popular websites, including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Snapchat, GitHub, Yahoo, Proton mail, Spotify, Netflix, LinkedIn, WordPress, Origin, Steam, and Microsoft, as shown in the image below




Part 2 ‚Äì Installation and Configuration

To use Zphisher, you can follow these steps:

Before downloading Zphisher, we prepared the Kali Linux terminal by update repositories by running the following commands and to ensure that environment was conducive for Zphisher to function

sudo apt update 
sudo apt full-upgrade -y

Next, we created a directory we called Zphisher and navigated into it using the following commands in succession.

mkdir zphisher
cd zphisher 

We cloned the Zphisher repository in a terminal in Kali Linux using the following command:



The url https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher.git after the git clone command is the link to the GitHub website.

The cloning output is confirmed as follows:


Navigate to the downloaded ‚Äúzphisher‚Äù directory to see the files within by running the following commands:

cd zphisher
ls

The output of the commands displayed the following files, similar to those contained in the GitHub web page:




Run the Zphisher script (contained in the zphisher.sh shell script file) by executing the following command:

bash zphisher.sh

A page opens with phishing page templates giving options of the type of phishing attacks that to can be performed by entering the corresponding number.



Upon typing the preferred option (e.g.14) against the ‚Äúselect option‚Äù prompt, the tool displays the tunnelling options installed upon running the bash zphisher.sh command. The phishing page template is executed using the corresponding number entered of the tunnelling option below.



Tunneling in the context of Zphisher package refers to the process of exposing a local server running on your machine to the internet. This allows you to access your local server from anywhere in the world, as if it were a public server.
  
Zphisher provides three tunneling options: Localhost, Cloudflared, and LocalXpose.

Localhost allows you to access your local server using a local IP address, typically 127.0.0.1 or localhost and is useful for testing your server on your own machine.

Cloudflared exposes your local server to the internet using a secure tunnel. It is useful for accessing your server from anywhere, while keeping your traffic encrypted.

LocalXpose uses LocalXpose's reverse proxy to expose your local server to the internet. This is similar to cloudflared, but with a simpler setup process. 

Upon typing the preferred option (e.g.2) against the ‚Äúport forwarding service‚Äù or tunnelling option prompt, a [y/N] (Yes or No) prompt to choose or use a custom port will appear.



Upon typing the preferred option (e.g. n for No) in response to the question ‚ÄúDo you want a Custom Port [y/N]‚Äù, the following output will be displayed.



It confirms launching Cloudfared and initializes (http://127.0.0.1:8080), which directs the browser to make a TCP connection to port 8080 of the local loopback address 127.0.0.1 known as "localhost". The loopback address is a special IP address that always refers back to the current device, allowing it to connect to itself.

Next is another Yes or No prompt (Do you want to change the Mask URL? [y/N) for the URL you want to use for the phishing page. A Yes answer means you provide the URL of your choice while a No answer means you use the default URL provided by Zphisher:



The tool provides Mask URL options that you can use or use a custom one. The option chosen was a Zphisher provide Mask URL. When copied and pasted onto a browser page, it opened a Linkedin login page that appeared legitimate. The user name and the password you type in will be harvested in the zphisher tool.




Once the victim enters their credentials, they will be displayed in the terminal as shown in the two images below:



The image above containing credentials identical to the preceding image represents credentials harvested from DEO Gumba‚Äôs network. 


Part 3 ‚Äì Testing the Vulnerability

After testing that Zphisher worked, I sent the same URL to Ayushma Koirala, who logged in successfully to the fake Linked-in page, which appears legitimate. The image below represents credentials harvested from her network.



When you the phishing email with the generated phishing link is sent to the target, they will click on the masked URL instead of the actual phishing URL. If the masked URL leads to a malicious website, it can potentially deceive them into trusting the malicious website, potentially resulting in them falling victim to a phishing attack and their credentials being harvested in realtime on zphisher.


Part 4 ‚Äì Project Preparation

To ensure all worked as expected within the very limited presentation time, it was more feasible to record a video showing how we harvested the credentials and then demonstrate prelude the video with a power presentation that we would be in control of.

We practiced this procedure several times to before recording the video to confirm that the presentation would run smoothly when we ran it for recording.

We put together a slide deck with images and videos illustrating:

Mitigating phishing attacks

Part 5 ‚Äì Mitigating Phishing Attacks

By implementing a multi-layered defence strategy that includes staff education, regular simulated phishing campaigns, email filtering tools, DMARC records, multi-factor authentication (MFA), separate work and personal devices, established mail providers like Gmail or Office 365, and access control and privilege management policies, organizations and individuals can reduce the risk of phishing attacks and protect their sensitive information.


Conducting staff education is a critical component of phishing attack mitigation. Employees should be trained to recognize and respond to phishing attacks, including how to identify suspicious emails, how to verify the sender's identity, and how to report phishing attempts. 
Regular simulated phishing campaigns can help employees stay vigilant and improve their phishing recognition skills.
Implementing email filtering tools can help detect and block phishing emails before they reach the user's inbox. These tools use a variety of techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, reputation analysis, and content analysis, to identify and filter out phishing emails.
Publishing DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) helps prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks. By publishing a DMARC record, organizations can specify how their email domains should be authenticated and what should happen to unauthenticated emails. This can help prevent attackers from sending phishing emails that appear to come from a legitimate domain. The DMARC record specifies the policy for handling emails that fail the authentication checks, such as quarantine or reject. 
Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) will ensure that users to provide multiple forms of authentication before accessing a system or application. This can include something the user knows (such as a password), something the user has (such as a security token), or something the user is (such as a biometric factor). MFA can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information, even if they have obtained the user's password.
Implementing separate work and personal devices policy can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information through personal devices that may not have the same level of security as work devices. This can include using separate devices for work and personal email, social media, and other online activities.
Using established mail providers like Gmail or Office 365, to offer advanced security features that can help detect and block phishing attacks. These features may include email filtering, spam blocking, and anti-phishing tools.
Implementing access control and privilege management policies can help prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive information by limiting access to authorized users and devices. This can include implementing role-based access control (RBAC), which restricts access to specific roles or job functions, and implementing least privilege principles, which limit access to the minimum level required to perform a task.
